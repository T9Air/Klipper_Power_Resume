# Klipper_Power_Resume
I recently moved from Marlin to Klipper, and what has annoyed me is that with Klipper, there is **NO** way to recover a print if it got canceled mid-print from a power outage, or the printer getting disconnected from the Raspberry Pi. However, I also did not like the resume ability in Marlin so much since it would cause the printer to stop as it logs where it currently is, which can (and does) cause blobs on the print. Since Klipper uses a Raspberry Pi, which is much more powerful than the onboard MCU, it should not have this problem. Therefore, I decided to create a logger for Klipper that is run after ***every*** single line in the file, and then using that log, you can use a Python script to make a new gcode file that ***only*** includes the gcode that was not run.
> NOTE: I HAVE TRIED IT ON A FEW PRINTS, AND THE LOGGING DOES NOT SEEM TO CREATE ANY VISIBLE DEFECTS IN THE PRINT, EVEN WHEN DOING A VASE MODE PRINT, WHICH WAS A BIG PROBLEM WITH MARLIN
