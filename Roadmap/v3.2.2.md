# V3.2.2

| Tasks | Status |
| ----- | ------ |
| Use 2 log files instead of one; 1 static file, and 1 dynamic file | &cross; |

For the 2 log files, this is the difference:

* Static file: Set once by UNLOG_FILE. Includes data such as the path to the gcode file and the printer settings
* Dynamic file: Changed by every LOG_FILE. Includes data such as the printer position and speed
