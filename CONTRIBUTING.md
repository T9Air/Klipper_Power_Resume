## Roadmap

1. All planned features can be found in the [Roadmap](https://github.com/T9Air/Klipper_Power_Resume/tree/main/Roadmap) directory
2. Each document in the roadmap corresponds to a new version (either major or minor), with all of the planned features for that release in it
3. Features that do not have a specified version will go in the [Future](https://github.com/T9Air/Klipper_Power_Resume/blob/main/Roadmap/Future.md) document
4. Features from the Future document will be moved to a version document before being released
5. Each feature will be split into tasks, which will be listed in the document

## Branches

1. Each document in the Roadmap directory will have its own branch
2. All tasks should be branched off of the branch for the document it is in
3. Each task should have its own branch if it meets any of these rules:
   1. It will cause the need to create a new file
   2. It will add/change the majority of a file
   3. It is a new feature that did not exist earlier
   4. It involves changing the docs
4. If a task does not meet any of the 4 rules, it should be included in the branch for the task that makes the most sense for it to be with
